###What is Roomberry

I was playing around with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robots for a while 
when I bought an [iRobot](http://www.irobot.de/) 
[Roomba 780](https://roombarobotreviews.com/irobot-roomba-780/). The Roomba seemed so
much more sturdy, solid an capable of doing things than my fragile Arduino bot.

So I looked on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com) for some cheaper roomba to play around with without risking 
to loose the clean floors we got used to.

I found one with a broken bumber sensor which was easy to fix following this 
[tutorial](http://andydunkel.net/gadgets/sonstiges/2012/03/11/roomba-fehler-9reparaturanleitung.html).
